Huffman Coding:-

Data structure used:

  Tree (list of tuples):
    The list representing the subtree has the same structure as that of the tree (implemente binary tree)

Operation:
  use the pseudocode mentioned in the question-
  Take a string and determine the relevant frequencies of the characters.
  Build and sort a list of tuples from lowest to highest frequencies.
  Build the Huffman Tree by assigning a binary code to each letter, using shorter codes for the more frequent letters. (This is the heart of the Huffman algorithm.)
  Trim the Huffman Tree (remove the frequencies from the previously built tree).
  Encode the text into its compressed form.
  Decode the text from its compressed form.

Time Complexity:
  to iterate from root to leaf in a binary tree (to assign codes) takes O(n(log(n))) time

Space Complexity:
  generally there is a reducion of about 40% to 60% in the sixze of encoded data. So for data size n, space complexity in avg case can be O(n/2)
